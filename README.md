# ⚖️ ODR_Platform – Online Dispute Resolution System

This project demonstrates how **Online Dispute Resolution (ODR)** brings the values of **law and justice** into the digital age. ODR provides a structured and user-friendly way to resolve disputes without physically going to court. It makes justice more **accessible, faster, and cost-effective**, especially for those in remote or underserved regions.

## 🌐 What is ODR?

ODR is a digital process for resolving disputes using online platforms and tools. It is useful for handling cases such as:

- 🛍️ Customer complaints  
- 💼 Business disagreements  
- 🏠 Tenant-landlord issues  
- 🛒 E-commerce or online fraud-related disputes

By integrating technology with legal principles, ODR platforms promote fairness, transparency, and efficiency in resolving conflicts.

## 🛠️ How the Platform Works

### 1️⃣ **User Registration & Complaint Submission**
- The user (individual or business) signs up on the platform.
- A new complaint/dispute is submitted along with documents and evidence (e.g., photos, emails, receipts).

### 2️⃣ **Notification to the Other Party**
- The opposing party is notified of the complaint and is invited to respond.

### 3️⃣ **Mediation or Arbitration Process**
- A neutral third party (mediator or arbitrator) is assigned.
- Both sides can communicate through chat, voice, or video calls to share their side of the story.

### 4️⃣ **Resolution or Settlement**
- The mediator helps both parties reach a fair agreement.
- If arbitration is used, a binding decision is made and shared with both parties.

### 5️⃣ **Closure**
- Once resolved, the outcome is recorded and the case is officially closed.
